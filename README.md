**[Project: Breast Cancer Diagnosis with EM & GMM in R](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/YourProjectRepo/blob/main/YourProject.pdf)**

- **Data Preprocessing** in R, preparing the dataset for analysis.
- Conducted **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, achieving dimensionality reduction.
- Expertly visualized high-dimensional data with **ggplot2**.
- Executed **Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm** and **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**, employing probabilistic soft clustering.
- Leveraged **Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence** to measure the distance between probability distributions of the original and reduced dimensions.
- Evaluated model performance via **Cross-Validation** and **Confusion Matrix** analysis.

**Skills Demonstrated**:

- Proficiency in R, and data visualization with ggplot2.
- Mastery of EM Algorithm and GMM for soft clustering.
- Advanced statistical understanding through PCA and KL Divergence.
- Rigorous model evaluation techniques including cross-validation and confusion matrix analysis.
